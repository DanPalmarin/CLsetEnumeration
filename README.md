# CLsetEnumeration
This is a program written in GAP used to enumerate all Cameron-Liebler sets (including all maximum cocliques) for 2-transitive groups. To work independently of Git, simply download and extract all files/folders from CLsetEnumeration.zip. Reference the Cameron_Liebler_Set_Enumeration_Manual.pdf before continuing.
